These are notes for chapter 9 of Deitel's How to Program C++

Client code can access a class public members with the: 
	- Dot operator (.)
	- Arrow operator (->) (pointer to an object)

Predicate function: function tests truth or false conditions

private members are meant to be accessed by the class public functions but not intended to be used
by the clients of the class 

const objects and const member functions to prevent modifications (principle of least privilege)

9.2 Separating class from implementation 

The header is meant to be a document to open and read; documentation. There should be no 
implementation whatsoever of the code in the header file. 

The client of a class only needs to know: 
	- What member functions to call
	- What arguments to provide to each member function
	- What return type to expect from each member function

Class implementation being hidden shoudl eliminate changes to client code based on implementation
